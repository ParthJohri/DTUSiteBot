## Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ParthJohri/DTUSiteBot.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd DTUSiteBot
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

1. Update `subjects.txt` file:

   Open the `subjects.txt` file and replace the existing subject codes with your desired subject codes. Each subject code should be on a new line.

2. Update `credentials.txt` file:

   Open the `credentials.txt` file and replace the existing credentials with your own. The file should contain your username on the first line and your password on the second line.

## Usage

1. Make sure you are in the project directory.

2. Run the bot:

   ```bash
   python main.py or python3 main.py
   ```

   The bot will start the subject registration process using the provided subject codes and credentials. It will log any errors or notifications to a log file in the `logs` directory, therefore create a logs folder in the directory.

3. Monitor the bot:

   You can monitor the bot's progress by checking the log file generated in the `logs` directory. The log file will provide information about any errors encountered during the registration process.

4. Customize the bot:

   If you want to modify the behavior of the bot or add additional features, you can edit the `main.py` file. Make sure to test your changes thoroughly before running the bot.
